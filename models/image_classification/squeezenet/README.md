# SqueezeNet
SqueezeNet is a small CNN which achieves AlexNet level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. SqueezeNet requires less communication across servers during distributed training, less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car and more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. The models perform image classification - they take images as input and classifies the major object in the image into a set of pre-defined classes. They are trained ImageNet dataset which contains images from 1000 classes. SqueezeNet models are highly efficient in terms of size and speed while providing good accuracies. This makes them ideal for platforms with strict constraints on size.

## Model
Squeezenet 1.1 gives AlexNet level of accuracy with 50X fewer parameters.
<!-- SqueezeNet 1.1 has 2.4x less computation and slightly fewer parameters than SqueezeNet 1.0, without sacrificing accuracy.-->

## Inference
We used MXNet as framework with gluon APIs to perform inference. View the notebook [imagenet_inference](../imagenet_inference.ipynb) to understand how to use above models for doing inference. Make sure to specify the appropriate model name in the notebook.

### Input 
All pre-trained models expect input images normalized in the same way, i.e. mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (N x 3 x H x W), where N is the batch size, and H and W are expected to be at least 224. The inference was done using a jpeg image.

### Preprocessing
The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. The transformation should preferrably happen at preprocessing.

```bash
import mxnet
from mxnet.gluon.data.vision import transforms
def preprocess(img):   
    '''
    
    Preprocessing required on the images for inference with mxnet gluon
    The function takes path to an image and returns processed tensor
    ''''''
    transform_fn = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(224),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])
    img = transform_fn(img)
    img = img.expand_dims(axis=0) # batchify
    
    return img
    
 ```
 

### Output
The model outputs image scores for each of the [1000 classes of ImageNet](../synset.txt).

### Postprocessing
The post-processing involves calculating the softmax probablility scores for each classes and sorting them to report the most probable classes.

```bash
import mxnet as mx
def postprocess(scores): 
    '''
    Postprocessing with mxnet gluon
    The function takes scores generated by network and returns the class IDs in decreasing order
    of probability
    ''''''
    prob = mx.ndarray.softmax(scores).asnumpy()
    prob = np.squeeze(prob)
    a = np.argsort(prob)[::-1]
    return a
    
 ```

### Inference with Model Server
To learn how to use model archives with Model Server, try out the [Model Server QuickStart](https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/README.md#quick-start) to get Model Server installed and tested. If you already have installed the server, you can use the commands below to start serving this model.
* **Start Server**:
```bash
mxnet-model-server --models squeezenet1_1=https://s3.amazonaws.com/onnx-model-zoo/squeezentnet/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.model
```

* **Run Prediction**:
```bash
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/model-server/inputs/kitten.jpg
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/squeezenet1_1/predict -F "data=@kitten.jpeg"
```
For inference requests with this model, Model Server expects the image to be passed in the data variable, which is the input layer's name in the model. In the previous example this was data=@kitten.jpeg.

## Dataset
Dataset used for train and validation: [ImageNet (ILSVRC2012)](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/). Check [imagenet_prep](../imagenet_prep.md) for guidelines on preparing the dataset.

## Validation accuracy
The accuracy obtained by the model on the validation set is mentioned above. The accuracy has been calculate on center cropped images and is within 1-2% of the accuracy obtained in the paper.
